Gravitat.js
========

This a work in progress. The idea behind this little program is to prototype an alternative interface for a student to take notes in class.

By clicking anywhere on the canvas, you can create a 'planet', that will orbit around your class, "CS170" in this example. You can halt the graph by pressing 's' and click on one of the planets to learn more about that concept.
